Even if you&rsquo;re not able to do a task a day, just go through the entire thing, that&rsquo;s the only task. It will keep the project&rsquo;s juices (ideas) flowing in the head.
Or even better, tell it to an imaginary audience.
Or even better, trial visual passes, to remove words (only when you have good understanding of above)
Hill charts, unknowns and knowns. Deep work needed vs. shallow work okay.

    It was a book-perfect place in the verandah beyond the doorstep of your old little place in Lower Parel, listening to the stories you would tell us, making clay figures with all the children there, and laughing at the little things you’d get happy over. The little me would wonder what a single visit from us had that you craved so much, no one else would get so very delighted. Time went by and we were able to surprise more than you would surprise us.

But even with the advent of animation that represented  the same number of dimensions as the real world, it wasn’t very common to see stories that weren’t merely a 3D mapping of their caricatured 2D versions.</p>

    <p>We in general instinctively take a not very positive view of politics. The curated news and media don’t help, and there are enough affairs to back or rebuke nearly every side of the debate about what is right. But  arguably, most systems of power that are stable aren’t always very good  either. So why can’t we have benevolent kings?</p>

But the  (relatively) new field of programming is popularly considered arcane,  partly because it derives from and touches upon so many other domains.  But what gets hidden behind all that detail is that it is actually a way  of thinking, and hence it isn’t generally thought of as something you’d  teach to little kids.</p>

    The Belief of a Search System … and doing the best despite uncertainties
So as it is our last day, I thought to share some thoughts/aids/ideas that helped me understand some of the concepts like fundamental to so many things that we&rsquo;ve been studying. I don&rsquo;t doubt that there would be plenty of mistakes (and dimness in labels) for a first draft, and will be glad to receive any and all corrections and feedback :)

    task list
Even if you&rsquo;re not able to do a task a day, just go through the entire thing, that&rsquo;s the only task. It will keep the project&rsquo;s juices (ideas) flowing in the head.
Or even better, tell it to an imaginary audience.
Or even better, trial visual passes, to remove words (only when you have good understanding of above)
Hill charts, unknowns and knowns. Deep work needed vs. shallow work okay.

    <p>After having discussed some thoughts on <a href="/2019/04/25/teaching-with-project-driven-motivation.html">Teaching Concepts via Project-driven Motivation</a>, we can now talk about how to go about implementing a system that given the data, does this for us, through a popular approach.</p>

    <p>Getting around to make a good Open Day title slide is no ordinary feat. Sometimes it’s drab, and sometimes you just get lucky. Here’s a tiny story.</p>

    <p>We come across plenty of data scenarios for our ERPNext users. It all  began when we needed them to be able to track sales. It would be nice to  fit in a tiny sales history graph on the user company master of our  product, so we started looking for options.</p>

    <p>Trips to our native place in Varanasi have long ceased to be the annual summer visits that they used to be during my school days. Especially for me, they are fewer and farther between than for my parents. This year however, mother and I decided to go for a week’s stay.</p>

    <p>We were all at the LUG (Linux Users Group) meet-up this weekend, with an  assorted group of programmers, contributors, professors and students  coming together to talk on all things open source. Here are some of the highlights.</p>

    <p>We in general instinctively take a not very positive view of politics. The curated news and media don’t help, and there are enough affairs to back or rebuke nearly every side of the debate about what is right. But  arguably, most systems of power that are stable aren’t always very good  either. So why can’t we have benevolent kings?</p>

    <p>I had been once asked during an interview, “What is this GitHub profile  that you mention?” referring to the section that occupied most of the  resume. I tried explaining it to them (one of whom was an IITian) on  their laptop as a place where you hosted your code.</p>
