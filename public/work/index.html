    An in-app interface to ERPNext where existing users can publish their inventory items and discovery others. The items are synced with a central marketplace server, setup as a Frappe instance. The in-app interface itself is dynamic, allowing users to browse items from the server by categories, check details, and message other users for more information.

    This was a general rewrite to forgo the legacy 9-step Setup Wizard that the first-time users would have to go through even before getting a glimpse of what their newly registered instance looked like. The first stage required only basic personal configuration, setting up with bootstrapped data to initialise the desk. The second would appear as an optional-but-essential wizard once inside, to enable users to import their own data, and guide them through a preliminary accounting flow.
